(1pt) Google “UIKit Catalog (iOS): Creating and Customizing UIKit Controls”, Download sample code “UICatalog” project in Xcode. Build and play the app, get familiar with all different kinds of UI elements. (You do not need to understand the code.)

2. (2pts) A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its divisors. Develop an app that accepts a start integer and an end integer. Search for the first perfect number in between if there is one. Use `UIAlertController` to how your result (i.e., report the first perfect number if exists; report no perfect number if none)

3. (2pts) Postfix notation (a.k.s Reverse Polish notation) is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands.  Infix notation is the notation commonly used in arithmetical formulae. For example, “5 1 2 + 4 × + 3 –” is a postfix notation that its equivalent infix notation is “5 + ((1 + 2) × 4) – 3”.  Although we are familiar with infix notation, it is actually easier to evaluate postfix notation using a stack.  There is an algorithm called Shunting-yard algorithm which can convert infix notations to postfix notation. Please implement an app that takes an infix notation from user and output its equivalent postfix notation.
